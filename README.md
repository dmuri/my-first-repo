# Java Chat App

This is a Java chat application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. The application has been developed using Java, and uses several tools for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Features

The Java chat app has the following features:

- Real-time messaging between users
- Chat history for each user
- User authentication and authorization
- User status notifications (e.g. online/offline)

## Tools

The following tools have been used for building, testing, and deploying the Java chat app:

- **Vagrant**: Vagrant is used for creating and managing virtual machines for development and testing purposes. The development environment is configured using a Vagrantfile.
- **Ansible**: Ansible is used for automating the configuration of the virtual machines created by Vagrant. Ansible playbooks are used to install the necessary software and dependencies for the chat app to run.
- **Jenkins**: Jenkins is used for building, testing, and deploying the chat app. Jenkins is configured to automatically run the build, test, and deployment pipeline whenever a new commit is made to the GitHub repository.
- **Maven**: Maven is used for managing the chat app's dependencies and building the application. Maven is configured to run the build process automatically in the Jenkins pipeline.
- **Solr**: Solr is used for indexing and searching chat history. It is used to provide users with the ability to search their chat history.
- **Nexus**: Nexus is used for managing the chat app's binary artifacts. Nexus is used to store the binary artifacts produced by the Maven build process, which can be used for deployment.

## Deployment Pipeline

The deployment pipeline for the Java chat app is as follows:

1. A new commit is made to the GitHub repository.
2. Jenkins detects the new commit and starts the build pipeline.
3. Jenkins pulls the code from GitHub and builds the application using Maven.
4. Jenkins runs the automated test suite to ensure that the application is working correctly.
5. Jenkins packages the application as a binary artifact and deploys it to Nexus.
6. Ansible is used to provision a new virtual machine with the necessary software and dependencies.
7. Ansible deploys the chat app to the virtual machine.
8. Solr is configured to index chat history.
9. The chat app is started on the virtual machine and is ready for use.

## How to Use

To use the Java chat app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox on your machine.
3. Run `vagrant up` to create the virtual machine and provision it using Ansible.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/chat`.
5. Register a new user account or log in with an existing account.
6. Start messaging with other users in real-time.

## Conclusion

The Java chat app is a robust, scalable, and reliable application that provides users with real-time messaging capabilities. The automated deployment pipeline ensures that the application is always up-to-date and ready to use.
